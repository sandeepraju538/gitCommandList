https://github.com/sandeepraju538/LoginAndRegistrationAnimation.git
Get started by creating a new file or uploading an existing file. We recommend every repository include a README, LICENSE, and .gitignore.

…or create a new repository on the command line
echo "# LoginAndRegistrationAnimation" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/sandeepraju538/LoginAndRegistrationAnimation.git
git push -u origin main
…or push an existing repository from the command line
git remote add origin https://github.com/sandeepraju538/LoginAndRegistrationAnimation.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
…or import code from another repository
You can initialize this repository with code from a Subversion, Mercurial, or TFS project.
